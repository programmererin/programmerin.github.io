						<h3>Technical Areas of Interest:</h3>
						<p>
							<b>Cybersecurity |  </b> I am getting my minor in Cybersecurity as well being a part of the <a href="https://cybersecurity.tamu.edu/education/texas-am-defense-cyber-leader-development-program/">Defense Cyber 
								Leader Development Program</a>. This year ('21-22), I'll be getting my Security+ certification through the program and will compete in Capture the Flag 
							competitions as well as working for the TAMU Security Operations Center. I am interested in working for the Department of Defense and becoming a security analyst, with the Network+ and Certified Ethical Hacker certifcations. I am a part of the CYBR and Women in CYBR clubs at A&M as well.<br></br>
							<b>Data Science |  </b> I really enjoy areas of statistics and mathematics that have been used to analyze larger systems and phenomena.
							I would like to delve more into the field of big data, hence the inspiration for the Texas Data Maps project. One of the main motivations behind 
							projects like these is the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/">DataIsBeautiful forum</a>, which showcases some pretty awesome and adventurous data graphs. Some of my favorites are Sankey graphs, bar chart races, and polar line plots. Currently, I am working with Texas salary data from the OpenPayrolls website.<br></br>
							<b>Geographic Information Systems | </b> GIS is a very keen interest of mine, since I love the video game <a href="https://www.geoguessr.com/">Geoguessr</a>-- which has players find where there are in the world using Google Street View. To become better at analyzing satellite imagery, I will be taking a GIS class 
								as a part of my cybersecurity minor. With that course, I'll be able to create projects from that using the open-source animation tool <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> that can effectively display geodata. 
							<br></br>
							<b>Fintech | </b> With the way Bitcoin and non-fungible tokens have exploded in the market, the financial technology sector has really got 
							my attention. Learning exactly how the blockchain works is something of extreme interest to me. This topic conveniently ties in with
							my interest in cybersecurity, where I'll be learning about similar systems that bitcoin began on.
