						<h2>Society of Women Engineers: Community Service</h2>
						<p align="justify">As a part of the Community Serivce committee, I met once a week to help plan and manage various service projects. Some
							of those included: visiting a retirement home and creating no-sew fleece blankets for <a href="https://www.projectlinus.org/volunteer/">Project Linus</a>. 
							We also planned for TAMU's Big Event
							and Kyle Field day.
						</p><br></br>
						<h2>Society of Women Engineers: Mentorship</h2>
						<p>After freshman year, I decided to become a mentor to the next class of freshmen and served as a mentor for one year. This was a really good teaching opportunity
							and helped me become a better leader.
						</p><br></br>
						<h2>United By Dance</h2>
						<p>I was the head chairperson of this community service project, which was a fundraiser benefitting the Special Olympics. The show was performed by local dance companies
							and the ticket and T-shirt sales went to charity. This was a four-month long project
							that encouraged strong leadership and time-management skills.
